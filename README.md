### Server Environment
Currently, the project does not have a live server environment for hosting the backend.
While the backend functionality is not hosted within this repository, the backend code is available in a separate repository. This setup allows for a clear separation of concerns and facilitates the maintenance and scalability of the project.
Despite the absence of a live backend, the frontend features have been fully implemented to demonstrate the application's functionality and user experience. However, it's important to note that the full functionality of the application, particularly form submissions and data storage, relies on backend APIs and database interactions.
When cloning the repository, it's important to keep in mind that certain features, such as form submissions, may require manual navigation through the application's interface. Typically, these actions would be handled by backend APIs to receive and process data, which would then be stored in a database.
